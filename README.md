#Dotfiles 

My config files and personal scripts I use on a daily basis, as well as a bash script for quick installation of my setup on Arch Linux based systems.

Many scripts are made considering [my suckless setup](https://github.com/dandeeccastro/dotfiles), so I'd recommend looking at both to understand what is happening here.
